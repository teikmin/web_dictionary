    Implements cloud workload protection using boto3 and google-cloud APIs for
    runtime security monitoring, process anomaly detection, and file integrity
    checking on EC2/GCE instances. Scans for cryptomining, reverse shells, and
    unauthorized binaries. Use when building runtime security controls for cloud
    compute workloads.

# Implementing Cloud Workload Protection
## When to Use

- When deploying or configuring implementing cloud workload protection capabilities in your environment
- When establishing security controls aligned to compliance requirements
- When building or improving security architecture for this domain
- When conducting security assessments that require this implementation

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with cloud security concepts and tools
- Access to a test or lab environment for safe execution
- Python 3.8+ with required dependencies installed
- Appropriate authorization for any testing activities

## Instructions

Monitor cloud workloads for runtime threats by checking process lists, network
connections, file integrity, and resource utilization anomalies.

```python
import boto3

ssm = boto3.client("ssm")
# Run command on EC2 instances to check for suspicious processes
response = ssm.send_command(
    InstanceIds=["i-1234567890abcdef0"],
    DocumentName="AWS-RunShellScript",
    Parameters={"commands": ["ps aux | grep -E 'xmrig|minerd|cryptonight'"]},
)
```

Key protection areas:
1. Process monitoring for cryptominers and reverse shells
2. File integrity monitoring on critical system files
3. Network connection auditing for C2 callbacks
4. Resource utilization anomaly detection (CPU spikes)
5. Unauthorized binary detection via hash comparison

## Examples

```python
# Check for unauthorized outbound connections
ssm.send_command(
    InstanceIds=instances,
    DocumentName="AWS-RunShellScript",
    Parameters={"commands": ["ss -tlnp | grep ESTABLISHED"]},
)
```
